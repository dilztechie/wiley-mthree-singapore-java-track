Inheritance

Super Class: Parent
Object of Super Class can Access the Members & Methods of the Super Class
Sub Class: Child
Object of the Sub Class can Access the Members & Methods of the Sub Class as well as Super Class

When you call a Constructor of a Sub Class -> First the Constructor of the Super Class is Executed

Polymorphism:
1. Constructor / Method Overloading: Various Forms of Constructors / Methods within the Same Standalone Class
2. Constructor / Method Overriding: Various Forms of Constructors / Methods which Matches the Parent Class -> Inheritance

One Parent Class can have more than One Child Class
