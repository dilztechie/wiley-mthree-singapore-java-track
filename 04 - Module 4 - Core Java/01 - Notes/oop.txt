* Encapsulation = Data Hiding -> You Hide the Members & Methods in a Entity called as "Class"
	* Members are Class Variables
	* Methods are Class Functions
* Instantiation = Creating an Instance of the Class -> Creating an Object of the Class

* Constructor = Allows you to Assign the Values to the Members of the Class during Instantiation
	* Looks like a Method
	* className & constructorName should be Same

* this => implicit Object of the same Class

* static Block of Code will always be Initialized and Executed by JVM at the Begining of the Execution of the Main Program
* To Access static Members & Methods you don't need to Instantiate the Class, rather Access them by the className
* Static has some Restrictions:
** They can only Directly Call other static Methods of their Class
** They can only Directly Access static members of their Class
** They cannot refer to "this" or "super" in any manner

* Polymorphism -> Many Forms
** Constructor Overloading - JVM will match the number of Arguments and Assign the Constructor
** Method Overloading - same Concept as Constructor Overloading

* Access Specifier -> Visibility Control
** default: when no access specifier
** private: visible only to it's class itself
*** Every private Members should have two Methods Each -> setters & getters

* Inner Classes
** Outer Class Members & Methods can be Accessed Directly inside Inner Class, not Vice-versa
