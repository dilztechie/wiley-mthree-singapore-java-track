* Find the Factorial of a Given Number
Number? 5
5! = 120

Step 1: start
Step 2: accept number 
Step 3: set factorial = 1, counter = 1
Step 4: while counter <= number, go to step 5. Else go to step 8
Step 5: set factorial = factorial * counter
Step 6: Add 1 to counter
Step 7: go to step 4
Step 8: display factorial
Step 9: end


* Calculate the Sum of all Odd Numbers & Sum of all Even Numbers from 1 upto a number given
Number? 100
Sum of Odd Numbers = 1+3+5+...+95+97+99
Sum of Even Numbers = 2+4+6+...+96+98+100

step 1: start
step 2: accept number
step 3: set counter = 1, evenCount = 0, oddCount = 0
step 4: while counter <= number, go to step 5 else go to step 11
step 5: if number%2 = 0 go to step 6 else go to step 8
step 6: add 1 to evenCount
step 7: add 1 to counter
step 8: add 1 to oddCount
step 9: add 1 to counter
step 10: go to step 4
step 11: display evenCount, oddCount
step 12: end


* Accept n & r from User
Calculate n!
Calculate r!
Calculate nPr = n! / (n-r)!
Calculate nCr = n! / ( (n-r)! * r! )

Step 1: start
Step 2: accept numbers n, r
Step 3: set nFactorial = 1, nCounter = 1
Step 4: while nCounter <= n, go to step 5. Else go to step 8
Step 5: set nFactorial = nFactorial * nCounter
Step 6: Add 1 to nCounter
Step 7: go to step 4
Step 8: display nFactorial
Step 9: set rFactorial = 1, rCounter = 1
step 10: while rCoutner <= r, go to step 11. else go to step 14
step 11: set rFactorial = rFactorial * rCounter
step 12: add 1 to rCounter
step 13: go to step 10
step 14: display rFactorial
step 15: end


* Display the total electricity bill charges of the month depending upon the number of units consumed by the customer as per the following criteria:
• for the first 100 units @ 5 per unit
• for next 150 units @ 10 per unit
• more than 250 units @ 20 per unit
Also add meter charges of 75 per month to calculate the total electricity bill

step 1: start
step 2: accept number
step 3: if number <= 100 go to step 4 else go to step 6
step 4: set a = (number*5) + 75
step 5: display a
step 6: if number <= 250 go to step 7 else go to step 9
step 7: set b = (number - 100)
step 8: display (b*10) + 5*100 + 75
step 9: set c = (number - 250)
step 10: display (c*20) + 150*10 + 5*100 + 75
step 11: end
