Algorithms: Any Computing Problem can be Solved by Executing a Series of Actions in a Specific Order

A Procedure for Solving a Problem in Terms of
1. the "actions" to Execute ans
2. the "order" in which these Actions Execute
is called an "Algorithm"


Pseudocode: An Informal Language that helps Programmers Develop Algorithm without having Syntax of any Programming Language

1. simple if

if student's grade is greater than or equal to 60
	Print "Passed"


2. if..else

if student's grade is greater than or equal to 60
	Print "Passed"
else
	Print "Failed"


3. Nested if..else

if student's grade is greater than or equal to 90
	Print "A"
else
	if student's grade is greater than or equal to 80
		Print "B"
	else
		if student's grade is greater than or equal to 70
			Print "C"
		else
			if student's grade is greater than or equal to 60
				Print "D"
			else
				Print "F"



* Write a Algorithm / Pseudocode to Accept 10 Student's Grade and Display Average of all Grades

Step 1: Begin
Step 2: Set total to zero
Step 3: Set counter to one
Step 4: While counter is less than or equal to ten
Step 5: Begin
Step 6:		Prompt the user for grade
Step 7:		Add grade to total
Step 8:		Add one to counter
Step 9: End
Step 10: Set average to total divided by ten
Step 11: Print "average=" average
Step 12: End
